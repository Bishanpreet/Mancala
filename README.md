# Mancala
Mancala is a two-player turn-based strategy board game played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces. Each player has six pits filled with four stones each at the beginning of the game. Players take turns picking up all the stones in one pit and distributing them counterclockwise one by one into each pit until they run out of stones. If the last stone lands in the player's store, they get another turn. If it lands in an empty pit on their side of the board and there are stones in the opposite pit on their opponent's side, they capture both their opponent's stones and their own stone and place them in their store. The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or when a player cannot make a move on their turn.
